Lists in the branch is compable with both Adguard&AdguardHome. Which means it supports Adguard **fully**, but AdguardHome **partially**.OnAndroid **doesn't** support AdguardHome.
It is also suggested to use extra filters both on AdguardHome and Adguard(iOS, Android,etc.) Here are my recommends, most of them can be found directly in AdguardHome setting.
*AdAway Default Blocklist, AdGuard DNS filter, The Big List of Hacked, Online Malicious URL, CHN: anti-AD(for users in China), WindowsSpyBlocker - Hosts spy rules.*
(These filters below cannot be found directly, and are not 100% supported by AdguardHome)*Easylist, EasylistChina, Chinese video stream service filter1(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xinggsf/Adblock-Plus-Rule/master/mv.txt), Chinise video stream service filter2(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jdlingyu/ad-wars/master/hosts)*
